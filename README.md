  Long story short:
</h2>
I have always been passionate about computer science since I was young. Between the ages of 12 and 15, I participated in contests like [Castor](https://castor-informatique.fr/) and [Algorea](https://algorea.org/#/) at school.
I then chose to specialize in **engineering sciences** and **mathematics** for my college diploma at the *Military College of Aix‑en‑Provence*, where I had the opportunity to undertake Arduino projects such as a surgical arm and a CO₂ detector.
Afterward, I enrolled at the Faculty of Nice in southern France, where I began learning SQL and Bash. However, it didn’t quite suit me, so I took a chance and signed up for the 42 Perpignan Piscine in **September 2024 🏊**.
I succeeded and am now completing the common core curriculum.
In the future, I plan to pursue the RCP7 diploma in [“Data architecture”](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/39774/).
